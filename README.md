## Background

On July 24, 2012, the Obama administration [introduced the Shopping Sheet](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/07/24/fact-sheet-administration-releases-final-version-financial-aid-shopping-),
a tool to help students better understand and compare the costs of attending college. U.S. Secretary of Education Duncan followed this announcement with an
[open letter](http://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/guid/secletter/120724.html) urging all higher education institutions to adopt
the new Shopping Sheet.

On September 28, 2012, the Department of Education provided a [HTML template](http://ifap.ed.gov/eannouncements/092812ImplementoftheFinancialAidShopSheet.html)
that could be used by institutions to display the Shopping Sheet on their website.

## Why Create This Template?

Although the Department of Education already provides a viable [HTML Shopping Sheet template](https://ifap.ed.gov/eannouncements/111416FinancialAidShoppingSheet20172018.html),
this open-source template builds and improves upon this template, including:

* __Responsive, mobile-friendly design__
* __Semantic markup__ for improved accessibility
* __Separating CSS and HTML__ for better separation of concerns
* __Reducing the overall size of the HTML markup__ for improved performance and easier modifiability
* __Reducing the use of images__ for improved performance and increased control of content through markup and styling
* __Reducing the file size of the images__ for increased performance
* __Providing simplified customization instructions__ for easier template customization
* __Adding a "Download XML" modal dialog__ for better integration of that feature within the interface

Specifically, performance was improved by the following metrics:

* __Size of HTML file reduced__ by __56%__ (from 40 KB to 17.6 KB)
* __Total number of images reduced__ by __84%__ (from 46 to 7)
* __Total size of website reduced__ by __53%__ (from 101 KB to 47.3 KB)

This repository itself also provides an open forum for people to suggest continued improvements to the template and also allows
developers to further extend the template.

## Customization

The template uses minimal, semantic markup which makes it straightforward to customize. As explained below, some of the customizations
require modifying the CSS declarations within the `main.css` file:

### Customizing the Logo

To change the university logo in the header, simply replace the `logo.png` file in the `images` directory. You will also want
to change the `alt` text of the `img` element that references that image in the `index.html` so that it will be accessible
to users with screenreaders.

### Customizing the Text

"UUS" and "University of the United States" appear throughout the text. Replace these with the name and acronym for your
university.

### Customizing Graduation Rate Percentage Marker Position

To adjust the position of the "Graduation Rate" percentage marker, modify the
appropriate value at the top of the `main.css` file under the "Graduation Rate Percentage"
comment header.

### Customizing National Average Repayment Rate Marker Position

To adjust the position of the "National Average Repayment Rate" percentage marker, modify the
appropriate values at the top of the `main.css` file under the "Repayment Rate National Average Message Box"
and "Repayment Rate National Average Message Box Arrow" comment headers.
