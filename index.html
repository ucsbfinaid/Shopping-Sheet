					<dt>Total Grants and Scholarships:</dt>
					<dd>
						Student aid funds that do not have to be repaid. Grants are often
						need-based, while scholarships are usually merit-based. Occasionally you
						might have to pay back part or all of a grant if, for example, you
						withdraw from school before finishing a semester.
					</dd>
					<dt>Net Costs:</dt>
					<dd>
						An estimate of the actual costs that you or your family will need to pay
						during the 2017–18 school year to cover education expenses at a particular
						school. Net costs are determined by taking the institution's cost of
						attendance and subtracting your grants and scholarships.
					</dd>
					<dt>Work-Study:</dt>
					<dd>
						A federal student aid program that provides part-time employment while you
						are enrolled in school to help pay your education expenses.
					</dd>
					<dt>Loans:</dt>
					<dd>
						Borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Loans from the federal
						government typically have a lower interest rate than loans from private
						lenders. Federal loans, listed from most advantageous to least
						advantageous, are called Federal Perkins Loans, Direct Subsidized Loans,
						Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Direct PLUS Loans. You can find more
						information about federal loans at StudentAid.gov.
					</dd>
					<dt>Family Contribution (also referred to as Expected Family Contribution):</dt>
					<dd>
						A number used by a school to calculate how much financial aid you
            are eligible to receive, if any. It’s based on the financial
            information you provided in your Free Application for Federal
            Student Aid (FAFSA). It’s not the amount of money your family will
            have to pay for college, nor is it the amount of federal student
            aid you will receive. The family contribution is reported to you
            on your Student Aid Report, also known as the SAR.
					</dd>
					<dt>Graduation Rate:</dt>
					<dd>
						The graduation rate after 150% of normal program completion time
            has elapsed. For schools that award predominately bachelor's
            (four-year) degrees, this is after six years, and for students
            seeking an associate’s (two-year) degree, this is after three
            years. For students seeking a certificate, the length of time
            depends on the certificate sought, for example, for a one-year
            certificate, after 18 months. These rates are only for full-time
            students enrolled for the first time.
					</dd>
					<dt>Repayment Rate:</dt>
					<dd>
						The share of students who have repaid at least $1 of the principal
            balance on their federal loans within 3 years of leaving school.
					</dd>
					<dt>Median Borrowing:</dt>
					<dd>
						The median federal debt of undergraduate borrowers who completed.
            This figure includes only federal loans; it excludes private
            student loans and parent PLUS loans.
					</dd>
