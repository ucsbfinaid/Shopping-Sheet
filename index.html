						or purchase of a personal computer; costs related to a disability; and
						reasonable costs for eligible study-abroad programs. For students
						attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees; an
						allowance for books, supplies, and transportation; and dependent care
						expenses.
					</dd>
					<dt>Total Grants and Scholarships:</dt>
					<dd>
						Student aid funds that do not have to be repaid. Grants are often
						need-based, while scholarships are usually merit-based. Occasionally you
						might have to pay back part or all of a grant if, for example, you
						withdraw from school before finishing a semester.
					</dd>
					<dt>Net Costs:</dt>
					<dd>
						An estimate of the actual costs that you or your family will need to pay
						during the 2016–17 school year to cover education expenses at a particular
						school. Net costs are determined by taking the institution's cost of
						attendance and subtracting your grants and scholarships.
					</dd>
					<dt>Work-Study:</dt>
					<dd>
						A federal student aid program that provides part-time employment while you
						are enrolled in school to help pay your education expenses.
					</dd>
					<dt>Loans:</dt>
					<dd>
						Borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Loans from the federal
						government typically have a lower interest rate than loans from private
						lenders. Federal loans, listed from most advantageous to least
						advantageous, are called Federal Perkins Loans, Direct Subsidized Loans,
						Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Direct PLUS Loans. You can find more
						information about federal loans at StudentAid.gov.
					</dd>
					<dt>Family Contribution (also referred to as Expected Family Contribution):</dt>
					<dd>
						A number used by a school to calculate how much financial aid you are
						eligible to receive, if any. It's based on the financial information you
						provided in your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). It's
						not the amount of money your family will have to pay for college, nor is
						it the amount of federal student aid you will receive. The family
						contribution is reported to you on your Student Aid Report, also known as
						the SAR.
					</dd>
					<dt>Graduation Rate:</dt>
					<dd>
						The percentage of students who graduate from an institution. This shows
						students who began their studies as first-time, full-time degree- or
						certificate-seeking students and completed their degree or certificate
						within 150 percent of "normal time." For example, for a four-year school,
						the graduation rate would be the percentage of students who completed that
						program within six years or less.
					</dd>
					<dt>Loan Default Rate:</dt>
					<dd>
						The percentage of student borrowers&mdash;undergraduate and graduate&mdash;who
						have failed to repay their federal loans within three years of leaving a
						particular school. A low loan default rate could mean that the
						institution's students are earning enough income after leaving school to
						successfully repay their loans.
					</dd>
					<dt>Median Borrowing:</dt>
					<dd>
						The amount in federal loans the typical undergraduate student takes out at
						a particular institution. It also indicates the monthly payments that an
						average student would pay on that amount using a 10-year repayment plan.
					</dd>
